# DSA
This repository contains my collection of DSA problems and solutions, implemented in C++ (and other languages when needed). It covers fundamental concepts, common coding interview questions, and practice problems across topics like:

Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists

Stacks, Queues, Hashing

Trees, Graphs, Heaps

Searching & Sorting

Dynamic Programming & Recursion


The goal of this repo is to build problem-solving skills, coding efficiency, and clarity of concepts, while keeping all solutions organized for future reference.
